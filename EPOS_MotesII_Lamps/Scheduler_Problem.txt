The code is not working using the default scheduler provided by the EPOSMoteII platform.
We are still deciding which scheduling algorithm and quantum to use, but for test purposes
we believe that it's okay to use Round_Robin. The problem is that while using the Round_Robin scheduler,
you get the feel that the LED is blinking, which should not be available to the user.

How to change the scheduler:

In the EPOSMoteII directory, edit the file include/traits.h

The scheduling algorithm should be located inside the templatized Traits<Thread> structure.
Also, you can change the quantum which each thread will be given by the scheduler.
